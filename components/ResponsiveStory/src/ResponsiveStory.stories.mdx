The `ResponsiveStory` lets you render any story in an `iframe` with a fancy device wrapper.
Since it is in an `iframe` all of the media queries work and your component will actually render at that screen size.
It will also display the source for the story you are documenting.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Usage">
    <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You can add a label to the story for extra context.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Label">
    <ResponsiveStory
      id="components-row--basic-usage"
      label="A label for the story"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

It can render as an `iPhone`, `iPad`, or `mac`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Devices">
    <div>
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" />
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" device="iPad" />
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" device="mac" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You can also let the user of your docs choose what device to render on.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Choose Device">
    <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" device="choose" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Choose the alignment of the device for the prettiest docs.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Align">
    <div>
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" />
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" align="center" />
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" align="end" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Show only the important portion of the device.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Top or Bottom">
    <div>
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" top={200} />
      <ResponsiveStory id="components-row--basic-usage" bottom={200} />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Rotate the device to landscape mode to visualize even more device states.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Rotate Mobile">
    <div>
      <ResponsiveStory isLandscape id="components-row--basic-usage" />
      <ResponsiveStory
        isLandscape
        id="components-row--basic-usage"
        device="iPad"
      />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Change the color of the header on the `iPhone` to match your product header's color.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="MobileÂ Header">
    <ResponsiveStory
      id="components-row--basic-usage"
      headerColor="black"
      headerText="white"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Add styles to the device wrapper.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Device Styles">
    <ResponsiveStory
      id="components-row--basic-usage"
      headerColor="black"
      headerText="white"
      screenStyles={{ paddingTop: 20 }}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Or even declare stories right withing MDX when writing MDX only stories.

<Canvas style={{ display: "none" }}>
  <Story name="test">
    <button>foo</button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ResponsiveStory
  id="components-responsive-story--test"
  headerColor="black"
  headerText="white"
/>
